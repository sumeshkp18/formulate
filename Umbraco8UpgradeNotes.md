# TODO

* Look into sample config files I had before (e.g., "web.sample.config" and "trees.sample.config").
* Maybe add back some of the before build tasks in the CSPROJ for the website.
* Review gitignore file (see TODO comments).
* Test if everything works after restoring from Git.
* Delete this file.

# Upgrade Notes

I'll keep track of the steps I've taken for the upgrade here.

* Recreated project files and added files/NuGet packages back to the new ones. Some files were removed temporarily in the process.
* Modify gitignore.
